# Delaware Voter Registration Totals

The purpose of this project is to recreate the State of Delaware's monthly voter registration totals website (https://elections.delaware.gov/services/candidate/regtotals.shtml) 
through creating a Python application. The first iteration of the application should be a searchable data table of registration totals by party, representative district, and election district. 
The default data table should be the current months registration totals. Users should be able to manipulate the data table in order to search by year and month back to 2010. 
We also want a mapping component to the application where users can scroll over particular counties to see the breakdown in voter registration totals.
